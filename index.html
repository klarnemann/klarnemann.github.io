	<h1>katelyn arnemann</h1>
	<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in neuroscience at UC Berkeley. My PhD thesis research is with the \
		<a href="https://jagustlab.neuro.berkeley.edu">Jagust Lab</a>, where I study human aging and \
		Alzheimer's disease from a network-framework using MRI and PET neuroimaging.</p></a></p>
	<h2>projects</h2>
	<h3>spatiotemporal properties of Alzheimer's disease progression</h3>
		<p>Alzheimer's disease pathology and atrophy follow characteristic spatiotemporal patterns.\
			In a series of projects, I seek to explain these spatiotemporal patterns using properties \
			of brain function in early-life.</p>
	<h4>early-life metabolic inefficiency explains topology of amyloid-beta</h4>
		<p>I derive a novel metric, "metabolic inefficiency" based on glucose metabolism and functional \
			connectivity in early-life. I find that metabolic inefficiency, \
			not hubs, explains the topology of amyloid-beta in cognitively normal older adults.</p>
	<h4>spread of amyloid-beta through the young functional MST</h4>
		<p>I explore the ability of the structure of the minimum spanning tree, extracted from the \
			young functional brain network, to explain the spread of amyloid-beta. We find that \
			amyloid-beta appears to originate in multiple epicenters and spread to neighboring \
			brain areas.</p>
	<h3>metabolic brain networks</h3>
		<p>I examine the covariance of glucose metabolism across individuals to define \
			metabolic brain networks at the group-level. I find that older adults exhibit \
			widespread elevations of metabolic correlation strength, consistent with \
			desegregation of brain networks in old age. This pattern was reduced in those \
			older adults at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.<\p>
