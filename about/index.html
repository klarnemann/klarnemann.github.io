	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I live in greater NYC area with my husband and daughter. I have since been working as a postdoctoral scholar in computational cognitive neuroscience since I earned my PhD in neuroscience in 2018. It's hard to escape the city, but when I spend as much time as possible in the great outdoors. I love to hike and explore new places. I enjoy taking photos and cooking delicious foods. And, while my BA in philsophy and cognitive science may be a few years behind me, I still love to delve into lifes great mysteries from time to time.</a></p>
