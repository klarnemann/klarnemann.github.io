	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I live in greater NYC area with my husband and daughter. I've been working as a postdoctoral research scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience since I earned my PhD in neuroscience in 2018. It's hard to escape the city, but when I do I spend as much time as possible hiking and exploring the great outdoors. I appreciate the awe-inspiring complexity of nature, which I enjoy documenting through photography. I also enjoy the meditation and delious reward of cooking. And, while my BA in philsophy and cognitive science may be a few years behind me, from time to time I still love to delve into lifes great mysteries.</p>
