	<h1>about me</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in Fairview Park, Ohio (a small, blue-collar subarb of Cleveland). In 2010, I recieved my B.A. from Case Western Reserve University, majoring in Cognitive Science and in Philosophy. As an undergraduate, I worked as a research assistant with <a href="http://tonyjack.org/">Dr. Anthony Jack</a>, studying individual differences and the distinct fMRI activation profiles of social and non-social reasoning. When I graduated, my now-husband James and I moved to Berkeley, California. I conducted postbac research with the US Department of Veteran's Affairs in affiliation with UC Berkeley under <a href="http://despolab.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Mark D'Esposito</a> and <a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/anthony.chen#toc-id3">Dr. Anthony Chen</a>, studying the rehabilitation of executive dysfunction in brain-injured patients using approaches from MVPA and graph theory. Presently, I am a PhD student in neuroscience at UC Berkeley. I am conducting my thesis research with <a href="https://jagustlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/">Dr. William Jagust</a>, using multimodal neuroimaging from MRI and PET to study aging and preclinincal Alzheimer's disease from a network perspective.</a></p>
	  <p>I live in Albany, California with my husband James and my daughter Samantha (born November, 2016). I love the outdoors, and enjoy a good nature hike. I also like to get-down in the kitchen. Or on the rock wall. I'm a closet philosopher, so be prepared if you get me chatting... </a></p>
