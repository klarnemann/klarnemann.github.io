	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I have been working as a data scientist in the healthcare industry since 2019, and am committed to leveraging data and machine learning to drive innovation in healthcare and clinical research. Currently I work as a data scientist at Unlearn.AI, where I am building a database of clinical trial data and developing disease progression models. Previously I worked as a research and data scientist at Datacubed Health, where I performed statistical validation and analyses on tools for remote data collection for clinical trials. As a neuroscientist, I developed computational models of human brain function, including progression of aging and Alzheimer's disease and rehabilitation from traumatic brain injury. I have a PhD in neuroscience from University of California, Berkeley and a BA in cognitive science and philosophy from Case Western Reserve University.</p>
	<p>My worldview is shaped by witnessing and understanding the awe-inspiring complexity and beauty of nature, which captivates me and drives my enthusiasm for science, philosophy, and the outdoors. I love everything outdoors, and one of my greatest joys is cultivating wonder in my daughter by taking her on outdoor "adventures". I often contemplate the human condition, and consider myself a humanist. My genuine care and concern about the environment and society push me toÂ balance my idealistic disposition with a healthy, realistic pragmatism.</p>
